        <h2>Sumedang Ready to create an Aerial Cable-Free City</h2>
        <p>Radioerksfm.com (Sumedang) – The Sumedang Regency Government continues to demonstrate its commitment to improving urban infrastructure by removing messy overhead cables.</p>

        <p>This effort aims to create an orderly, aesthetically pleasing urban environment that supports a smart city system.</p>

        <p>Concrete steps are being taken through potential collaboration with the Association of Telecommunications Network Operators (Apjatel), particularly in organizing optical cables to be buried underground in an integrated manner.</p>

        <p>The collaboration was discussed in a meeting between the Deputy Regent of Sumedang, M. Fajar Aldila, and Regional Secretary Tuti Ruswati with Apjatel West Java Regional Coordinator, chaired by Dudi Sudrajat Abdurachim, on Friday (5/23/2025) in the Deputy Regent's office.</p>

        <p>“Underground cables are not just about city aesthetics, but also support the acceleration of digital transformation towards a smart city, minimize fire risks, and create a safe and orderly urban space,” explained Dudi.</p>

        <p>He emphasized that the systematic arrangement of fiber optic cables is one of the key elements in supporting a more organized and people-friendly city landscape.</p>

        <p>In addition to disrupting the city's visual appearance, cables hanging haphazardly are also considered a safety hazard.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, Deputy Regent Fajar highlighted the urgency of organizing the cable network in the Jatinangor area.</p>

        <p>This area is considered strategic due to its multicultural character and high population density.</p>

        <p>He said that underground cable management in this area could serve as a model for the integration of technology-based surveillance systems.</p>

        <p>“Young people there are active on social media. If our city planning is neat and modern, it will certainly have a positive impact. We are currently developing a smart pole system with poles containing drones, CCTV, and operators to monitor security, because Jatinangor is now quite vulnerable,” he said.</p>

        <p>Fajar also emphasized the importance of underground cable integration in supporting community activities, especially in terms of digital transactions, which have now become an essential need.</p>

        <p>However, he reminded the importance of anticipatory measures given Sumedang's unstable geological conditions.</p>

        <p>“There must be exploratory and topographical studies to ensure that cable installation does not cause problems in the future. Because the costs will be borne by the regional budget if a disaster or damage occurs,” he emphasized.</p>

        <p>He hopes that the discussion on cooperation between the Sumedang Regency Government and Apjatel can be immediately followed up with implementation.</p>

        <p>“If the budget is available and the program is on target, why not implement it immediately?” he concluded.</p>
